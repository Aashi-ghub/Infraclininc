- ‚úÖ View workflow statistics and project overview

### 3. Site Engineer Workflow
- ‚úÖ Add borelog details in addable sub-part fashion
- ‚úÖ Save drafts and submit for review
- ‚úÖ View submission history and review feedback
- ‚úÖ Make revisions when returned

### 4. Approval Engineer (Reviewer) Workflow
- ‚úÖ Review submitted borelogs
- ‚úÖ Approve, reject, or return for revision
- ‚úÖ Add detailed comments for correction
- ‚úÖ View pending review queue

### 5. Lab Engineer Workflow
- ‚úÖ View assigned lab tests
- ‚úÖ Update test progress and status
- ‚úÖ Submit test results and data
- ‚úÖ Track completion dates and priorities

## üéØ Role-Based Access Control

### Admin
- **Full access**: All projects, users, and data
- **User management**: Create and assign users to projects
- **System overview**: Complete workflow dashboard

### Project Manager
- **Project access**: Only assigned projects
- **Bulk operations**: CSV upload for multiple borelogs
- **Lab assignment**: Assign tests to approved borelogs
- **Statistics**: View project workflow statistics

### Site Engineer
- **Project access**: Only assigned projects
- **Borelog creation**: Add detailed geological data
- **Submission**: Submit borelogs for review
- **Revision**: Edit returned borelogs

### Approval Engineer
- **Review access**: Only assigned projects
- **Review actions**: Approve/reject/return borelogs
- **Comments**: Provide detailed feedback
- **Queue management**: View pending reviews

### Lab Engineer
- **Lab assignments**: View assigned tests
- **Progress tracking**: Update test status
- **Results submission**: Submit test data
- **Priority management**: Handle test priorities

## üìä Workflow States

### Borelog Status Flow
1. **Draft**: Initial creation by Site Engineer
2. **Submitted**: Sent for review
3. **Approved**: Passed review, ready for lab testing
4. **Rejected**: Failed review, requires new submission
5. **Returned for Revision**: Needs corrections before approval

### Lab Assignment Status Flow
1. **Assigned**: Created by Project Manager
2. **In Progress**: Being worked on by Lab Engineer
3. **Completed**: Tests finished, results submitted
4. **Reviewed**: Results reviewed and approved
